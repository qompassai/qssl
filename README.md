<details id="Dual-License Notice">
  <summary><strong>What a Dual-License Means</strong></summary>

### Protection for Vulnerable Populations

The dual licensing aims to address the cybersecurity gap that disproportionately affects underserved populations. As highlighted by recent attacks[^1], low-income residents, seniors, and foreign language speakers face higher-than-average risks of being victims of cyberattacks. By offering both open-source and commercial licensing options, we encourage the development of cybersecurity solutions that can reach these vulnerable groups while also enabling sustainable development and support.

### Preventing Malicious Use

The AGPL-3.0 license ensures that any modifications to the software remain open source, preventing bad actors from creating closed-source variants that could be used for exploitation. This is especially crucial given the rising threats to vulnerable communities, including children in educational settings. The attack on Minneapolis Public Schools, which resulted in the leak of 300,000 files and a $1 million ransom demand, highlights the importance of transparency and security[^8].

### Addressing Cybersecurity in Critical Sectors

The commercial license option allows for tailored solutions in critical sectors such as healthcare, which has seen significant impacts from cyberattacks. For example, the recent Change Healthcare attack[^4] affected millions of Americans and caused widespread disruption for hospitals and other providers. In January 2025, CISA[^2] and FDA[^3] jointly warned of critical backdoor vulnerabilities in Contec CMS8000 patient monitors, revealing how medical devices could be compromised for unauthorized remote access and patient data manipulation.

### Supporting Cybersecurity Awareness

The dual licensing model supports initiatives like the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) efforts to improve cybersecurity awareness[^7] in "target rich" sectors, including K-12 education[^5]. By allowing both open-source and commercial use, we aim to facilitate the development of tools that support these critical awareness and protection efforts.

### Bridging the Digital Divide

The unfortunate reality is that too many individuals and organizations have gone into a frenzy in every facet of our daily lives[^6]. These unfortunate folks identify themselves with their talk of "10X" returns and building towards Artificial General Intelligence aka "AGI" while offering GPT wrappers. Our dual licensing approach aims to acknowledge this deeply concerning predatory paradigm with clear eyes while still operating to bring the best parts of the open-source community with our services and solutions.

### Recent Cybersecurity Attacks

Recent attacks underscore the importance of robust cybersecurity measures:

- The Change Healthcare cyberattack in February 2024 affected millions of Americans and caused significant disruption to healthcare providers.
- The White House and Congress jointly designated October 2024 as Cybersecurity Awareness Month. This designation comes with over 100 actions that align the Federal government and public/private sector partners are taking to help every man, woman, and child to safely navigate the age of AI.

By offering both open source and commercial licensing options, we strive to create a balance that promotes innovation and accessibility. We address the complex cybersecurity challenges faced by vulnerable populations and critical infrastructure sectors as the foundation of our solutions, not an afterthought..
